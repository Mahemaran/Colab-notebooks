Handling Large Datasets:
If the user uploads a huge CSV or Excel file (e.g., 100,000 rows), how would you optimize the document loading and processing to ensure the system remains responsive? Would you consider processing the data in chunks or implementing some form of data sampling?

Model Response Accuracy:
You are using different models like GPT-3.5, Google Gemini, and Falcon. How would you assess the accuracy and relevance of the responses generated by each model for the same input question? Would you implement any feedback loop or validation step to compare the models' answers?

Embedding Model Selection:
Imagine you have multiple pre-trained models available for embedding generation. How would you decide which one to use based on the type of document (e.g., text-heavy content vs. numerical data) or the question being asked?

Handling Special Characters and Non-Text Elements:
In some documents (like PDFs or scanned images converted to text), there may be special characters, images, or non-text elements. How would you ensure these elements don't negatively impact the accuracy of the embeddings or the question-answering process?

Document Contextualization:
If the user asks a question that refers to specific sections or details within a large document, how could you adjust the vector search or the way you retrieve context to ensure that the answer is directly tied to the most relevant content in the document?

Vector Store Scalability:
As more documents are uploaded and more embeddings are generated, the FAISS vector store will grow. How would you handle scaling the vector store to ensure efficient retrieval of answers as the number of documents increases over time?

Customizing the Text Splitter:
The RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter splits the document into chunks of 500 characters. However, if the document contains long paragraphs or technical sections that would be better split at sentence or word boundaries, how could you customize the text splitter to improve context accuracy?

Integrating Other File Formats:
Suppose a user uploads a JSON or XML file, both of which have hierarchical data. How would you modify the load_files function to handle these file formats, ensuring that the data is properly parsed and prepared for embedding and vector search?

Caching Results:
To optimize performance, especially when the user asks repeated questions about the same document, how would you implement a caching mechanism for the vector search and model responses? Would you store answers to frequently asked questions, embeddings, or search results?

Multi-Language Support:
If the documents uploaded by users contain content in multiple languages (e.g., English, Spanish, French), how would you adapt the code to handle multilingual input? Would you adjust the embedding model, text splitting, or search strategy to support multiple languages?

User Customization:
If users want to customize how the system interprets their questions (e.g., enabling synonyms, adjusting response length, or focusing on specific sections of a document), how would you allow this customization within the existing architecture? Would you introduce user-configurable parameters in the prompt or API calls?

Model and Embedding Updating:
Over time, newer and better language models or embedding techniques may become available. How would you structure the system to easily update or swap out models or embeddings without requiring major refactoring? Would you make the selection of models more dynamic?

Complex Question Parsing:
What if the user asks a question that contains multiple parts (e.g., "What is the capital of France, and what is its population?")? How would you modify the question processing pipeline to handle multi-part questions and ensure that each part is addressed properly?

Error Recovery:
Suppose an error occurs during the embedding generation or vector search (e.g., a network timeout while fetching embeddings). How would you design the error recovery process? Would you retry the operation, alert the user, or fall back to a different model or method?

Cross-Document Comparison:
If the user uploads multiple documents (e.g., several PDFs or a mix of CSV and Excel files), and asks a comparative question (e.g., "Which document contains more mentions of AI?"), how would you approach cross-document comparison in the current architecture?

Security Considerations:
If users upload sensitive documents, what security measures would you implement to protect the uploaded files, their content, and the generated embeddings? Would you apply encryption or any other privacy-focused practices during document handling?

Query Response Time Optimization:
With multiple documents, large embeddings, and complex models, the time to generate a response could become long. What strategies would you employ to optimize response time, such as pre-computing embeddings or caching frequently used documents?

Real-Time Model Monitoring:
If multiple users are interacting with the system at the same time, how would you ensure that the system can handle real-time traffic without affecting response quality? Would you introduce any load-balancing techniques or parallel processing for vector searches?

Feedback Loop for Model Improvements:
If the users rate the quality of responses, how would you implement a feedback loop to improve the model over time? Would you store user feedback and retrain the model periodically based on it, or would you use some other method to enhance the system?

User Interaction History:
How would you track user interaction history (e.g., past questions, uploaded documents, or preferences) to provide a personalized experience for each user? Would you store session data, or implement user-specific settings or recommendations?
